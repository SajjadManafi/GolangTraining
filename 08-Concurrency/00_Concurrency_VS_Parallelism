Concurrency vs parallelism
But when people hear the word concurrency they often think of parallelism,
a related but quite distinct concept. In programming,
concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, 
while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations. 
Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
